                <h2>About</h2>
                <h5>Charismatic <span>Bhartiya</span> Revolutionary</h5>
                <p>Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, in the village of Banga near
                     Lyallpur district in Punjab, British India. He was an Indian freedom 
                     fighter who is considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries 
                     of the Indian independence movement. Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Republican
                    Association (HRA) at a young age and became involved in revolutionary activities.
                    He participated in several acts of sabotage against British institutions,
                    including an attempt to bomb the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi.
                    In 1929, he and two other activists were convicted of assassinating John Saunders,
                    a British police officer. Singh was executed by hanging on March 23, 1931, at Lahore
                    jail at the age of 23. Despite his short life, Bhagat Singh left a lasting legacy in
                    the struggle for Indian independence. He is revered by many as a martyr and symbol
                    of resistance to British colonialism in India. His example continues to inspire new
                     generations of activists worldwide.</p>
